It was a classic case of opposites attracting, but she was sure she could change him. (Or, as she thought of it, \'redeem him.\') Then came the day he proposed. He slipped a gorgeous ring on her finger and she just knew that if she asked \"Is this a conflict diamond?\" it would ruin her relationship. But she also knew that if she didn\'t ask, the relationship would ruin her. So she said no, broke it off, and he let her keep the ring.\n\nNeither of them dreamed that the ring was a beacon to a spirit of righteousness, which found in Chartreuse a good-hearted person for whom the spirit had always been willing but the flesh, alas, weak.

She certainly wasn\'t expecting a supervillain.\nWhat followed is what professional soldiers affectionately call a \"donkey rodeo.\" The traffickers were hugely outgunned, but before the supervillain died from an excess of bullets he tore apart the two Coast Guard cutters and summoned two dozen starving sharks to prey on survivors in the water.

She figured it was plain ol\' yoppo, the Amazon hallucinogen noted for producing spectacular headaches, copious vomiting, and a sensation that you\'re at the center of the cosmos with everything else everywhere twirling, gently twirling around you.\n\nWell, it wasn\'t yoppo. Near as she can tell, her angelic self-mate used to be a tree and the natives had been grinding it up for years as a nasal ingestible. (It smelled wonderful.) But unfortunately for Sylvia, she took her ceremonial huff just as a rival native group attacked, toting brand-new shotguns they\'d been given by narcotraffickers hoping to chop down the trees and make a secret road through the jungle. (Their American engineer dubbed it \"Eight Miles Highway.\")\n\nHer hosts were slaughtered without mercy, but Sylvia transformed into an incandescently beautiful woman and was doing swimmingly against the bad guys until they started surrendering and her angel insisted that she honor it.\nSylvia, as an anthropologist, knew for a fact that this particular tribe firmly believed no real oath could be made with outsiders (who were, they felt, not even actually real). She knew they\'d go back on it the minute it became convenient. Knew it.\n\nSo she broke the truce first. When she was marching them back towards a civilized prison, she waited until her angel was quiescent and her captives were lining up to cross a stream on a fallen tree. Then she opened fire with one of their own shotguns. She brought down two before the others swarmed and she had to invoke the angel again, but by that point her enemies had decided that this \'surrender\' thing wasn\'t even worth faking, and fought to the death.\nAs her angel wept within her, Sylvia was already plotting how she could befoul the drug runners\' plans as a mortal and bring her angel in only for ethically pure stuff. That was in 2007 and since then she\'s been the holy terror of the whole long river valley. Ironically, she wears a gorilla costume when she does most of her crime-busting because a glowing figure of resplendent glory draws too much attention. Even though gorillas aren\'t native to the Amazon.\nSylvia competed at bodybuilding and triathlons before she went to South America, and she lived in the jungle for two years before the tribe accepted her enough to blast angel dust up her nose. So she can hold her own with just a big heavy pipe-wrench and determination. But she\'s becoming increasingly frayed as she tries to balance pragmatism (but no powers) with power (but back- breaking idealism). So far she\'s kept most of her misbehavior hidden from her angel, but the strict rules she plays by when glowing have made her feel increasingly entitled to sucker-punches, arson and intimidation when she\'s working without celestial backup. She\'s also broadened her \"enforcement purview\" from murderers and drug runners to lumber barons, polluters and corrupt government officials.","notes":"","rider_name":"Gorillawrench","rider_strategy":null,"powers":{"0":"body_control","1":"righteous_arm"},"aspects":{0:"wings", 1:"halo", 2:'radiance'},"specialties":{},"strategies":{"Patient":1,"Cunning":2,"Generosity":1,"Greed":2,"Knowledge":3,"Espionage":2,"Open":3,"Sly":1,"Courage":3,"Cruelty":2,"Endurance":1,"Cowardice":3,"Insightful":1,"Devious":1,"Nurture":1,"Corruption":1,"Honesty":2,"Deceit":1},"image_url":"","meta_tags":{'group':'Cherubs in Abusive Relationships'},"modified":null,"created":null,"is_pregen":true}

But while the executive and legislative branches have splayed out their tawdry charms to the diabolically inclined, the judiciary seems to get short shrift. Maybe it\'s just because there are bibles around for swearing-in all the time.\nJudge Jane Attenborough gets right around that by using a specially printed fake bible. Every book has been altered, and not always subtly, either. Most of the Ten Commandments in her swearing-book (as she charmingly calls it) simply have \"not\" tidily removed from behind various \"shalts\" and reinserted in others. \"Thou shalt commit adultery,\" \"Thou shalt not honor thy father and thy mother,\" and so on. Similar vandalism has been wreaked on the Beatitudes, producing verses like \"Stupid are the meek, for they shall be called big yellow pussies.\"\n\nBut that wasn\'t Jane\'s idea. A far more detail-oriented demon put that volume together as a hobby, and Jane stole it from him after throwing him in the path of a monk from the Holy See who\'d been rescued from an illegal pit-fighting ring as a child and who now fights crime as Brother Vengeance. (He\'s a gritty hero, if you care.)\n\nNo, Jane just sits in court and listens to cases and excludes evidence and runs things by the book as much as possible, only stooping to commit procedural errors when necessary. Various scumbags in her area (Horry County, South Carolina-it\'s a real county, look it up!) have been promised either a mistrial or a not-guilty verdict in return for \"favors to be named later\" by a sweaty greek guy known as Priapus Ambrosia. Priapus is a colorful character renowned, in the South Carolina underworld, not only for his body odor, colorblind taste in suits and outrageous name, but also for making people sign agreements in blood. Oh, and for getting people off the hook. He\'s known for that, too.\n\nPriapus is, of course, just Jane in disguise, and while many of her agreements with crooks and skels end with sold souls, she also has them do all kinds of gun running, race baiting, hate crimes and general larceny. She makes sure they leave Horry County to do it, though.
