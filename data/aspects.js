To soar above the rabble to have limbs that look like they belong in some hideous soul-food stew? Kind of an easy pick..." Maybe you\'re not even reading this! Maybe you just skipped right to the wings! Well if you can\'t be bothered to read this, screw you!</p><p>Cloven Hooves don\'t mean you can walk on uneven surfaces with great confidence. They mean you\'re empowered to make faustian pacts. If you\'re not familiar with the myth of Doctor Faustus, he\'s the guy who sold his soul for magic power. In this case, you\'re the buyer. Cloven Hooves means you can eat people\'s souls.</p><p>Who\'s eviller now, wing-man?</p><p>Here\'s how this works. You don\'t get to immediately take the whole thing, but you can offer humans a chance to succeed, guaranteed, at an action of their choosing. After that, you get a little something for you. It\'s the free market at its finest. ("Don\'t think of it as cloven hooves, but rather as the Invisible Hand.")</p><p>The market isn\'t open to everyone: People who are already Hellbinders are bad credit risks, since some other demon already has made its territorial pissings all over their souls. Similarly, you can\'t make a pact with the mortal who\'s your other half: You\'re already helping that ingrate, so he doesn\'t need or merit added help. Anyone with an angel in him is protected too.</p><p>You can have one pact active at a time for every point you have in CUNNING. If your CUNNING drops, one of your pacts immediately breaks, so it\'s often a good idea to limit them so that they end after a week or a month or by the next full moon. You have to manifest the hooves to complete the pact, though it\'s often a good idea to keep them hidden while negotiating-I recommend cowboy boots. Or just conducting all your bargains over the phone or through eBay. Needless to say, you need to get the mortal to agree voluntarily, but how hard is that? I mean, seriously. Half of them don\'t even believe they have souls.</p><p>When the circumstances agreed upon occur, the mortal gains a Master Die to one STRATEGY, which remains for the rest of the scene. At the end of that scene, the mortal who made the pact loses a point off one STRATEGY of the demon\'s choice, and the demon gains a point in one Sinister Tactic of the demon\'s choice. The demon does not need to be present for this.</p><p>Bonus? If the mortal dies while using that Master Die, his soul becomes your plaything in the afterlife and you get a free point in your CUNNING.</p><p>Wings. Feh.</p>',

	'description':'<p>You get a tiny bit transparent and a whole lot ectoplasmic. You can walk through walls or people, cross traffic without looking, and avoid all manner of physical hassles. It makes you immaterial.</p><p>The question of "wouldn\'t I get pulled to the center of the earth?" is handled with a bit of selective finesse on your part. If you choose to allow an object to resist you a little, it resists you a little. So you can walk on floors and the ground. It even works on liquids, so you can walk on water. Gasses are out though, so this doesn\'t let you fly. (That takes wings, described below.) Moreover, you can\'t let an object resist and then pick it up. Anything stronger or heavier than a soap bubble or cloud of steam is going to fall through you. You can lean against that wall, but if you push it you\'re going through. You can grip that doorknob, but as soon as you try and turn it, your fingers poke through.</p><p>This brings up the drawback of Ghost Form. It\'s great for watching people and delivering spooooooky messages, it works a treat for getting out of prisons, but when you\'re in Ghost Form, you have no physical effect on the world. Often, you\'re immaterial in the figurative sense as well. That is, unless you switch off Ghost Form and punch someone when he isn\'t expecting it. Or unless you have a power like Telekinesis.</p><p>You can switch Ghost Form off and reactivate it once per scene for every point you have in DEVIOUS. It takes an action to solidify or to pass out of phase, though you don\'t need to roll anything. At the end of the scene, Ghost Form wears off even if you didn\'t use up all your changes.</p><p>Thus, if you have DEVIOUS 1, you can activate Ghost Form and walk between the bars of your cell and head into the evidence room, turn it off and get dressed in your costume, then turn it on and walk through the walls (and probably, the night-sticks and taser-lines of your pathetic captors) and away. But if you deactivate it to take a swing at one of those cops, you don\'t get it back. If you had DEVIOUS 4, you could go get your costume and a bloodstained bayonet from a murder case, turn immaterial, walk out, let the cops tire themselves swinging at you, turn physical, stab one, turn ghostly and repeat that twice more.</p><p>When you phase out, you can carry about ten pounds of clothing and gear with you, but nothing living. You can\'t use this to shred items by turning part of (say) that motorcycle helmet intangible and leaving part solid, either.</p><p>If you activate any other physical power that depends on making contact with a solid object (Summon, Banish, the Flame-Wreathed Aspect, That Hideous Strength) it doesn\'t work while you\'re ghosted. But if you come back into phase, it works normally.</p>',

	'description':'<p>Ah, flight, the dream of mortals and the majestic transport method of devil and superhero alike. Whether you want to dodge the slings and arrows of outrageous costumed angel-handlers, or to swoop down and bash the crap out of people, Wings can let it happen.</p><p>Given the loose and narrative nature of how events go in Better Angels, there\'s no reason to get all hard and fast and miles-per-hour about how fast you can fly. As with all Aspects, you can keep your wings active for one scene, so you\'re not going to fly from Chicago to Memphis, no matter how CUNNING you are. The following guidelines should get you close enough.</p><table><theader><tr><th>CUNNING</th><th>Effects</th></tr></theader><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>You can fly at the pace of a brisk jog, circling to raise yourself ten feet per action. You no longer take any damage from falling if you have your wings out.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>You can fly at a sprinter\'s pace and gain fifteen feet per action in height, more or less.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>You can now shoot straight up, thirty feet just like that and cruise at the speed of a car in light city traffic. You can hover in place, where lesser demons are stuck wheeling and circling like some manky bat.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>You can reach fifty feet in just moments and swoop down with enough force and precision to enhance hand-to-hand weapon strikes, along with kicks and punches. If you\'d normally have no weapon bonus, the dive- bomb attack gives you a +1 weapon bonus. If you\'d normally get a +1 or +2 bonus, it rises by a single point. If you\'d have a +3 weapon bonus, it stays maxed out. That\'s just the way it is.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>You can zip up to the top of a ten-story building in a single bound, fly as fast as a speeding locomotive, and get all the advantages of the previous levels as you wish.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you\'re flying and someone else is walking, he can\'t punch you. You\'re effectively immune from hand-to-hand attacks from earthbound people unless you make a closeup attack on them. They can still pepper you with gunfire, of course. Also, at the GM\'s discretion, someone with the Giant Aspect active might reach you, using increased reach and speed.</p><p>You know what else Wings are good for? They\'re giant extra limbs that make it harder for people to hit the torso, where you keep your organs and spine and other good bits. Once per scene, if your wings are out, you can arbitrarily declare that a physical attack hit your wings instead of your body. This breaks a wing and prevents you from flying for the rest of the scene, but you don\'t take damage (meaning, you don\'t have to shift around any stats or erase them). The next time you summon your wings, they\'re perfectly fine. You could even shut them off for the scene and re-summon them unharmed, if you feel like gambling and/or burning STRATEGY points.</p>',
